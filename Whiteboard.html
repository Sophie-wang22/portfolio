                    Whiteboard is a productivity platform that helps users plan their lives and achieve long term goals. The site is broken 
                    down into three main sections - the Dashboard, Workspace, and Calendar - which communicate with each other to create a 
                    seamless user experience. Some key features of the app include task dragging onto the calendar, flexible project views, 
                    and habit tracking on the Dashboard.

                    Our main goal this summer as designers was to user test the site and make any adjustments before our partners started beta 
                    testing the site in the fall. Because we were working with a team of three developers, we only had had around four weeks to 
                    finish the web designs in order to give the developers enough time to implement any changes.

                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                    Due to our limited time frame, we needed to make user testing as efficient as possible. We wanted to get as much feedback within 
                    these one hour testing sessions, since we wouldn’t have time to refine our designs and test again. We spent a lot of time brainstorming 
                    on different ways to test our ideas.

                    After discussing the pros and cons of testing with the unfinished developed site versus the Figma prototype, <strong>we ended up choosing 
                    to use the developed site</strong> due to the higher level of interaction it would allow our users. We also discussed what types of 
                    interactions we wanted to have our users perform and the level of guidance we wanted to give them. We wanted these sessions to 
                    be guided enough to where our users had an objective in mind, but not too structured so they couldn’t explore the site on their own. 
                    In the end, we decided to give our users a simple task:

                    We interviewed users within the target demographic of our product - young professionals who are avid planners and enjoy organizing their 
                    lives. From these sessions, we drew these four key takeaways:

                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                        In the previous Dashboard view, overdue tasks were displayed within the same section as a user’s current tasks. A lot of users 
                        felt that having these tasks were distracting, especially if they couldn’t be checked off immediately, leaving this lingering overdue 
                        task there in front of them.

                        When we split up the design responsibilities of the platform during Spring 2020, there were three designers, and each of them 
                        took one page of the app (the Dashboard, Workspace, and Calendar). As a result, there were small stylistic differences in how each 
                        page was designed. During our interviews, a lot of users demonstrated preference for the Dashboard project modal versus the Workspace 
                        project modal, since they were able to visualize their project’s progress.
