                        Maintaining relationships with people is hard. Individuals are busy, have different interests, and with the COVID-19 
                        pandemic requiring people to social distance, it is impossible to physically force a friend to get a meal to catch up. 
                        For our final project to the class “Intro to UI/UX Design,” we wanted to address the problem of lost connectivity between 
                        existing social groups to help users who feel like the recent pandemic has hindered their current relationships.

                    <p>
                    To start tackling this problem, we interviewed college students to better understand the characteristics of meaningful 
                    interactions with friends. From our user interviews, we identified three main pain points related to maintaining connections 
                    in a remote setting.

                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                        Being physically distant from friends has made it difficult for individuals to create new memories together. All of 
                        our interviewees missed the campus environment where they could go get coffee with friends for a quick study break 
                        or go ice skating around the pond on a Saturday afternoon. <strong>Shared experiences help individuals create meaningful memories</strong> 
                        with one another when they are in a common space, but being remote greatly limits what types of activities users can do.

                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                    The classic “let’s get a meal” conversation often feels more like a hallway greeting than an action item for people to follow up on. 
                    One of our users described the mass of “I miss you!” messages on Instagram as “inauthentic” given that many of them come from people 
                    who don’t regularly interact. Because these messages lack authenticity, it dissuades users from reaching out in the first place.

                    <p>
                        Even if our users are able to get over the hurdle of getting people to agree to an event, scheduling a time to host that event 
                        is a complete headache in itself. Our users used various methods to achieve this goal, from sending When2meets in group chats 
                        to texting every single person until they get a response. Oftentimes though, no one in the group takes the responsibility of 
                        planning the get-together, leading it once again to never occur.

                    After our initial user interviews, we thought some more about the key obstacles our users were facing. We realized that the 
                    main pain point that we wanted to address was that our users felt they couldn’t create new memories with existing friends. 
                    This problem existed for our users both because of the remote environment and the complexities surrounding actually scheduling 
                    events. From here, we settled on our final HMW:

                <div class="case-study-quote">
                    “When I’m gaming with my friends over Zoom, I don’t feel like we’re video calling just to catch up — it feels like we’re making 
                    new memories together.”
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                        This user described gaming with friends as one of the main ways he kept in touch with them while in isolation. It was 
                        interesting thow he had actually been able to create a shared experience with friends, even in this remote environment. 
                        He explained that gaming provides him and his friends with a common goal, as well as mutual experiences to talk about since 
                        they can chat about whatever is going on in the game. This anecdote inspired us to develop a solution around creating 
                        experiences similar to gaming. The key features we decided on for our app are:

                    <p>
                    We decided on three main principles for our solution — convenience, simplicity, and delight. Based on user and industry 
                    research, we decided that these principles would address the main pain points of our users while keeping a seamless user 
                    experience.

                    wanted to make sure that our designs followed our laid out principles and allowed for a seamless and enjoyable experience

                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                    As we continued to iterate screens, we realized that we would have to make some sacrifices in order to follow the 
                    principles we laid out. The hardest principle to keep in mind was minimal features, since we kept getting carried 
                    away by the numerous possibilities we could add to our app. The following three decision points guided our final product. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study-subheader-text">Decision #1: We decided against a navigation menu to simplify the user flow, instead using back arrows and modals</div>
                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                    After conducting competitive research of other connectivity platforms, we realized that many of them contained a bottom 
                    menu bar for navigation. Since our app doesn’t have many distinct pages, we thought that having no navigation menu would 
                    greatly simplify the user flow. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class=phone-screen-image-row>
                    <div><img src="pictures/Connect/dec1-1.svg"></div>

                    <div><img src="pictures/Connect/dec1-3.svg"></div>
                </div>


                <div class="case-study-subheader-text">Decision #2: We used doodles and bright colors to create a delightful and playful experience for our users. </div>
                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                    At the core, our app is a chat and scheduling platform, however we wanted to make interactions playful and engaging. As a result, we incorporated 
                    bright colors and icons into the scheduling interaction, to make users want to continue using our app.
                    </p>

                    <div><img src="pictures/Connect/dec2-3.svg"></div>
                </div>


                <div class="case-study-subheader-text">Decision #3: We chose a flat UI design to emphasize our app’s focus on functionality and efficency.</div>
                <div class="case-study-body-text">
                    <p>
                    Because our designs include cards for upcoming events, we originally used drop shadows to indicate that these were clickable. However after user 
                    testing our app and talking with fellow designers, we realized that the drop shadows came across as “distracting” and “out of place.” Thus, we decided 
                    to go with a flat design for the entire interface in order to maintain simplicity.  
                    </p>

                        Connect is a mobile planning app that provides opportunities for users to create meaningful memories with friends either online or in person. 
                        It automatically schedules times and proposes activities for friends to do based on their calendar availability. Below are our final designs -
